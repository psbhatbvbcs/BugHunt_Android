#Bug Fixes and Enhancements for App:

#Basic Bugs:

#Decimal Digits Bug:

Adding two decimal points? Haha, You can't. Add conditions to prevent this. Look around line 69 in MainActivity.kt

Issue: When using decimals as operands, the number of digits after the decimal point ('n') is not exactly 2.
Hint: Utilize Kotlin functions for decimal formatting to ensure exactly 2 digits after the decimal point.

#Splash Screen Persistence Bug:
Issue: After attempting to exit the app, the splash screen image reappears and stays indefinitely.
Hint: Implement a mechanism to end or kill the splash screen after it has been displayed for 3 seconds in beginning.

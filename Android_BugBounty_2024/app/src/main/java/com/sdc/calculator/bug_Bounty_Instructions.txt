#Bug Fixes and Enhancements for App:

#Basic Bugs:

#Decimal Digits Bug:
Issue: When using decimals as operands, the number of digits after the decimal point ('n') is not exactly 2.
Hint: Utilize Kotlin functions for decimal formatting to ensure exactly 2 digits after the decimal point.

#Splash Screen Persistence Bug:
Issue: After attempting to exit the app, the splash screen image reappears and stays indefinitely.
Hint: Implement a mechanism to end or kill the splash screen after it has been displayed for 3 seconds in beginning.

#Non-Digit Operand Crash:
Issue: App crashes when one or both operands are not digits (e.g., dot ".").
Hint 1: Use conditional statements to handle non-digit operands.
Hint 2: Display a toast message for an invalid format.

#Operator Buttons Bug:
Issue: Some operator buttons are not working as intended.
Hint 1: Implement the functionality using conditional or switch statements.
Hint 2: Adapt syntax from C to Kotlin while ensuring the functionality remains the same.

#Advanced Bugs:
#Responsive Layout Bug:
Issue: The layout is disoriented when switching from portrait to landscape modes(Rotation of Screen).
Hint: Create separate layouts for portrait and landscape modes to ensure a responsive design.

#Splash Screen as Activity Bug:
Issue: Splash screen is created as an activity instead of using a splash API.
Hint: Consult online resources and the documentation to implement a splash API for a more efficient splash screen.
